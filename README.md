# Introduction
Identifying risk factors associated with COVID-19 lethality is crucial in combating the ongoing pandemic. In this study, we developed lethality predictive models for each epidemiological wave and for the overall dataset using the Extreme Gradient Boosting technique and analyzed them using Shapley values to determine the contribution levels of various features, including demographics, comorbidities, medical units, and recent medical information from confirmed COVID-19 cases in Mexico between February 23, 2020, and April 15, 2022. 

In conclusion, this study identified several significant risk factors associated with COVID-19 lethality in Mexico, which could aid policymakers in developing targeted interventions to reduce mortality rates.
